# Research
Kendra Wu is getting started as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Statistical/ Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the [Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk) of [Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk) at [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk). Her research uses mathematics and statistics to study who becomes sick from various infectious diseases and why. In greater details, she studies the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases using computational tools, such as mathematical and statistical models, in order to quantify the risk, severity, patterns, and behaviors of the spread under different scenarios. These investigations aim to understand the science of infectious disease transmission, inform the design of more effective treatment options, prevention strategies, and control interventions, as well as to prepare the community and the healthcare sector for the amount and nature of the casualties they will get in case of an outbreak. Kendra's focus has been on respiratory pathogens, and more recently Ebola virus disease (EVD), but she is interested in other pathogens as well. She is also involved in research in health promotion and epidemiology of aging.

# Education \& Training
Kendra received her degree in clinical geriatric medicine and PhD in public health/ community medicine with a focus of infectious disease epidemiology from [The University of Hong Kong](http://www.hku.hk), where she was a Swire Schoar and a Postgraduate Scholarship recipient. She also holds a Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip) in Epidemology from [London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk), and an undergraduate and a Master's degree in engineering from [The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://umich.edu), USA. She was a visiting researcher at MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling (now [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-outbreaks)) of [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk) in 2010-2011. Extramurally, Kendra is a Probationary Officer at [Auxiliary Medical Service](https://www.ams.gov.hk) in Hong Kong.
